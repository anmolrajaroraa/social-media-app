A cool, efficient, and easy-to-use Social Media App for communicating with friends.

* **Easy-To-Use:** We have made it painless to communicate with friends. Designed simple views for each page in our application, and we will regularly update and introduce just the best features when you need them. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
